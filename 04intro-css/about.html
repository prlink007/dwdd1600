        <h1>ABOUT THE CREATORS</h1>
        <h2>Paul Lingenbrink</h2>
        <p><strong> <em>"Hi! Im Paul!"</em></strong> </p>
        <p>Paul Lingenbrink is a graphic designer by trade and a film enthusiast at heart. With a background in visual
            storytelling and a BFA in Graphic Design, Paul has always been fascinated by the power of imagery,
            composition, and pacing — whether in a poster or on the big screen. His passion for cinema led him to study
            film theory and narrative structure at the Pacific School of Visual Arts, where he explored everything from
            classic auteur filmmaking to contemporary indie cinema. Over the years, Paul has combined his love for
            design and film into various creative projects, including short film storyboarding, poster design for local
            film festivals, and most recently, the creation of CritiqueCinema. He built this space to help others dive
            deeper into the art of film — not just to watch, but to truly see.
        </p>

        <h2>Ely Vargas</h2>
        <p><strong><em>"Ummm, What do you want me to say?"</em></strong></p>
        <p>Ely Vargas, Paul’s husband and partner in cinephile adventures, brings a whole different flavor to
            CritiqueCinema. While his academic background is in Computer Science, his heart has always been with the
            movies. A true film fanatic, Ely can quote Tarantino and debate Kubrick with the best of them — all while
            troubleshooting a broken website or optimizing code behind the scenes. His love for cinema started with
            late-night horror marathons and has since grown into a deep appreciation for everything from foreign
            arthouse gems to classic Hollywood. Watching and dissecting films together has become a shared ritual
            between Paul and Ely, blending their unique perspectives — Paul’s as a designer, Ely’s as a techie — into
            something creative, thoughtful, and fun. Ely helps bring CritiqueCinema to life not only through his tech
            savvy, but with his infectious enthusiasm for film.
        </p>

        <h2>And of Course… Unico the Cat</h2>

        <p><strong><em>"MEOW!"</em></strong></p>
        <p>Rounding out the CritiqueCinema crew is Unico — the true star of the living room. As Paul and Ely’s fluffy
            companion and unofficial emotional support cinephile, Unico may not have a degree in film studies, but he
            does have a sixth sense for cozy movie nights. Whether it's curling up during a slow-burn drama or pouncing
            during a high-stakes action scene, Unico is always part of the cinematic experience. He’s particularly fond
            of warm blankets, opening credits, and anything with dramatic music. While he might sleep through most of
            the third act, his snuggles and purring approval are an essential part of our film-watching ritual.

        <h2>A Few of Our Favorite Film Terms</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt><strong>Visual Storytelling</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>Paul’s design playground — using imagery, color, and layout to convey a narrative without a single
                    word.</em></dd>

            <dt><strong>Director's Cut</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>Ely's preferred version — often longer, weirder, and with all the extra scenes studios didn’t want
                    you to see.</em></dd>

            <dt><strong>Catnap Cut</strong></dt>
            <dd><em>Unico's personal favorite — the part of the movie perfect for a cozy nap, usually during slow
                    dialogue or credits.</em></dd>
